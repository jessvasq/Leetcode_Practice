*SQL PRACTICE* 
175. Combine Two Tables

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+

*Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead. Return the result table in any order. *

#First Solution 
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, A.city, A.state 
FROM Person P LEFT JOIN Address A
on P.personId = A.addressId

#Second Solution
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state 
FROM Person p LEFT JOIN Address a 
ON p.personId = a.addressId


*183. Customers Who Never Order
Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.*

Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 
Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 
*First Solution*
SELECT name FROM Customers c 
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.id = o.customerId 
WHERE o.customerId = NULL;

*Second Solution*
SELECT name AS customers 
FROM Customers 
WHERE customers.id 
NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders)
